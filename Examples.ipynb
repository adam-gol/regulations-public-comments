    "**Outputs can be written to a CSV file, a SQLite database, or both**. In the case of a SQLite database, if it does not yet exist, it will be automatically created, set up, and populated, so no experience with SQLite is necessary (until you want to query it for data, that is). One benefit of using the SQLite database is that unique indexes ensure that no duplicates are inserted. We handle this with CSVs less efficiently, by scanning over the CSV for duplicate IDs after we're done with the full output. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we have to work around duplicates at all is because of how the Regulations.gov API's pagination mechanism works (the reason: you get up to 20 pages per \"query\", each of which has up to 250 items. If you need more than 250x20 = 5000 items, you have to use a second \"query\", which is the same as the first, but filtered to a lastModifiedDate >= the maximum lastModifiedDate of the previous query. As a result, there will be repeated items. Unfortunately, this is necessary because there may be multiple items with the same lastModifiedDate)."
